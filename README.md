# Challenge-1-Horiseon

## Description

This challenge focused on refactoring the existing code (improving it without changing what it does).

- What was your motivation?
The user (A marketing agency) wanted a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that their website is optimized for search engines.

I learned that many of the elements that are similiar can be combined in the CSS in order to make the code run a bit more smooth.
